# Dotfiles

These are my desktop configuration files. I manage them using
[yolk](https://github.com/elkowar/yolk).

They are not designed to be used directly by anyone but me (unless we happen to
have precisely the same preferences), and there is no support or installation
help provided.

These files are rarely ever stable, as I'm always finding things to improve.

Feel free to use them as inspiration or learning material, or to steal from it
for your own configuration :)
